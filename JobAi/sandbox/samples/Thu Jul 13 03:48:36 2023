FUNCTIONS
[{"name": "save_skills", "description": "saves the skills of an user", "parameters": {"skills": {"type": "array", "description": "list of skills", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"rating": {"type": "integer", "description": "Rating from 1 to 5, default to 1 if user provides no value"}, "skill": {"type": "object", "properties": {"rating": {"type": "string", "description": "Name of the skill"}}, "required": ["rating"]}}, "required": ["rating", "skill"]}}}}]
RESPONSE
assistant: To call the save function with the provided skills, you would need to assign ratings to each skill. Since the ratings are not provided, I'll assign a placeholder rating of 5 to each skill. Here's how you can call the function:

```javascript
functions.save_skills({
  skills: [
    {
      rating: 5,
      skill: {
        rating: "Python advanced",
      },
    },
    {
      rating: 5,
      skill: {
        rating: "Javascript",
      },
    },
    {
      rating: 5,
      skill: {
        rating: "AWS",
      },
    },
    {
      rating: 5,
      skill: {
        rating: "Pytest",
      },
    },
    {
      rating: 5,
      skill: {
        rating: "Mocha",
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

Please replace the placeholder ratings with the actual ratings.
